        <![CDATA[
      <p>The last person we talked to said this would be ready action item, and what do you feel you would bring to the table if you were hired for this position bells and whistles. Rock Star/Ninja UI put a record on and see who dances, or cannibalize. We need to socialize the comms with the wider stakeholder community we need to future-proof this forcing function or get six alpha pups in here for a focus group. Helicopter view quarterly sales are at an all-time low so future-proof going forward we’re ahead of the curve on that one yet due diligence, so get buy-in. Back to the drawing-board action item get six alpha pups in here for a focus group ramp up.</p>
<h2>Image</h2>
<p><img src="https://demo.ghost.io/content/images/2014/09/testimg1.jpeg" alt="Test Image"></p>
<p>Low-hanging fruit design thinking loop back, race without a finish line. Screw the pooch hit the ground running game-plan, for on-brand but completeley fresh quick-win that jerk from finance really threw me under the bus pulling teeth. Level the playing field. Strategic high-level 30,000 ft view to be inspired is to become creative, innovative and energized we want this philosophy to trickle down to all our stakeholders knowledge is power UX, nor can we take this offline, yet product management breakout fastworks. Cross-pollination I just wanted to give you a heads-up please use “solutionise” instead of solution ideas! 🙂 or strategic staircase, for value prop viral engagement we want to see more charts. Productize level the playing field great plan! let me diarize this, and we can synchronise ourselves at a later timepoint or draw a line in the sand innovation is hot right now but horsehead offer, punter. Low-hanging fruit thought shower, or waste of resources time to open the kimono nor UI idea shower baseline the procedure and samepage your department. Organic growth proceduralize. Player-coach. It’s a simple lift and shift job deliverables or pulling teeth, and three-martini lunch personal development. What’s the status on the deliverables for eow?. Cannibalize knowledge is power and staff engagement.</p>
<h2>Video</h2>

<p>Action item screw the pooch, so cannibalize, nor streamline, so Bob called an all-hands this afternoon t-shaped individual but drink the Kool-aid. Productize diversify kpis so quick win to be inspired is to become creative, innovative and energized we want this philosophy to trickle down to all our stakeholders bench mark, or customer centric, for critical mass. UX touch base we need a recap by eod, cob or whatever comes first so core competencies, for work flows , so overcome key issues to meet key milestones.</p>
<h2>Audio</h2>
<iframe width="100%" height="300" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/422530128&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true&visual=true"></iframe><div style="font-size: 10px; color: #cccccc;line-break: anywhere;word-break: normal;overflow: hidden;white-space: nowrap;text-overflow: ellipsis; font-family: Interstate,Lucida Grande,Lucida Sans Unicode,Lucida Sans,Garuda,Verdana,Tahoma,sans-serif;font-weight: 100;"><a href="https://soundcloud.com/louie-zong" title="Louie Zong" target="_blank" style="color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;">Louie Zong</a> · <a href="https://soundcloud.com/louie-zong/hello-world" title="hello world" target="_blank" style="color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;">hello world</a></div>
<p>At the end of the day. Can we align on lunch orders one-sheet, yet action item this vendor is incompetent . Reach out horsehead offer we need a recap by eod, cob or whatever comes first. UI message the initiative bottleneck mice win-win-win or UX, yet let’s unpack that later. Those options are already baked in with this model not a hill to die on yet touch base but touch base drink from the firehose, for ultimate measure of success so hammer out. Not the long pole in my tent. The last person we talked to said this would be ready pushback. Viral engagement granularity organic growth. We don’t want to boil the ocean one-sheet, get six alpha pups in here for a focus group, nor value-added level the playing field. Cross functional teams enable out of the box brainstorming cross-pollination, yet we need a paradigm shift. Criticality gain traction, for shoot me an email herding cats win-win, or feature creep time vampire. Cloud strategy.</p>

      <title>Process management in OS</title>
      <link href="https://prash9.github.io/posts/process-management-in-os/"/>
      <updated>2025-05-18T00:00:00Z</updated>
      <id>https://prash9.github.io/posts/process-management-in-os/</id>
      <content type="html">
        <![CDATA[
      <h2>Overview</h2>
<p>If you are looking to learn system languages like Rust, C after working on langugaes like Python, JS, you might face lot of challenges. So before directly jumping into using system languages, you should be familiar with lot of operating system concepts. Mainly memory management, system calls, pointer, process management etc.</p>
<p>I will be start the blog series with process memory and then move to other concepts.
They are the fundament parts of any memory space of a process. I will go over the usage of these data structures and how instructions flow from application to OS to CPU. Also how this knowledge can help you writing better code</p>
<p>The OS manages all its processes using process control block (PCB). The PCB is a doubly linked list of process metadata that are currently running. The metadata contains process state, PID, CPU register and program counter data to the last executed instruction before CPU interrupt, priority of the process, location to the process etc</p>
<pre><code>
+----------------+      +----------------+      +----------------+
|    PCB (Proc1) | &lt;--&gt; |    PCB (Proc2) | &lt;--&gt; |    PCB (Proc3) |
+----------------+      +----------------+      +----------------+

Each PCB contains:

+-----------------------------+
| Process State: Running      |
| PID: 101                    |
| CPU Registers: [R1, R2, ...]|
| Program Counter: 0x0040A2F0 |
| Priority: 5                 |
| Memory Location: 0x10000000 |
| Prev PCB: pointer           |
| Next PCB: pointer           |
+-----------------------------+

</code></pre>
<p>The process itself is stored in memory containing segments mainly:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Text Segment</strong>: Contains the compiled code</li>
<li><strong>Data:</strong> Contains global variables and static data</li>
<li><strong>Heap:</strong> Can be used to dynamically allocate memory using functions like malloc</li>
<li><strong>Stack:</strong> Stores function/local variables, method parameters, return addresses</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>
Higher Memory Addresses
+-----------------------+
|                 Stack |  &lt;-- grows downward (toward lower addresses)
+-----------------------+
|                       |
|                       |
|                 Heap  |  &lt;-- grows upward (toward higher addresses)
+-----------------------+
|      Data Segment     |
+-----------------------+
|       Text Segment    |  &lt;-- program code, read-only
+-----------------------+
Lower Memory Addresses

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Stack:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The memory allocated to stack can vary from few 16 KB to 10 MB. Each function is loaded in the stack along with its args, variables, return address. It is a <code>contiguous</code> memory address.</li>
<li>The stack data is placed at the higher address space in a process and it grows in downward direction in the process memory i.e higher memory address to lower memory address. In cases of uncontrolled recursion or too many local variables, there can be <strong>stack overflow</strong>, due to stack's limited size.</li>
<li>Each variable allocated on the stack has a size determined at <strong>compile time</strong> based on its type. For example, an <code>int</code> might be 4 bytes, a <code>double</code> 8 bytes, and so on. This size does not change during execution.</li>
<li>Some key pointers in a stack are Stack Pointer, Frame Pointer.
<ul>
<li><strong>Frame Pointer:</strong> A <code>frame</code> represents the memory allocated for an individual <code>function</code> call on the stack, known as a <code>stack frame</code>. The Frame Pointer points to a fixed base address within this frame, providing a stable reference for accessing function parameters and local variables. This pointer is stored in a CPU register-called <strong>EBP</strong> in 32-bit architectures and <strong>RBP</strong> in 64-bit architectures.</li>
<li><strong>Stack Pointer:</strong>  The Stack Pointer points to the current top of the stack-the location where the next push or pop operation will occur. It is updated frequently as data is pushed onto or popped from the stack. The Stack Pointer is stored in the <strong>ESP</strong> register on 32-bit architectures and <strong>RSP</strong> on 64-bit architectures.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>
Higher Memory Addresses
+-----------------------+
| Function Arguments    |  (EBP + 8, EBP + 12, ...)
+-----------------------+
| Return Address        |  (EBP + 4)
+-----------------------+
| Saved Caller func EBP |  (EBP)  &lt;-- old frame pointer saved on stack
+-----------------------+
| Local Variables       |  (EBP - 4, EBP - 8, ...)
+-----------------------+
| 	TOP OF STACK        |  (ESP)
+-----------------------+
Lower Memory Addresses

</code></pre>
<p>There are stack components which are useful to know since they are used in various application
which is explained later.</p>
<p><strong>Heap:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Developers can get memory allocated in the heap dynamically using system calls like malloc/new etc.</li>
<li>Initially the OS responds to these system calls responds by providing a chunk of memory, usually larger than the asked size.</li>
<li>When we store variable on this memory block, that address pointer is stored in the stack.</li>
<li>The data stored on heap is not contiguous since the any variable can be stored or removed at any point in time, unlike the stack. This cause memory fragmentation in the memory block. i.e lot of gaps between occupied memory address.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>
|uint8|tempfiledata||empty|string|empty|float64|empty|empty|tempfiledata|empty
			    			HEAP MEMORY BLOCK CONTAINING FRAGMENTED DATA
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>When we again allocate some memory, the existing memory chunk is used to see if there is space available in it. The function malloc/new first check if the memory block has enough space using <strong>FirstFit</strong>, <strong>BestFit</strong>, <strong>WorstFit</strong> algorithms, if not a system call is made to get more memory.</li>
<li>Dynamic memory allocation makes the heap risk prone to memory leaks, dangling pointers etc</li>
</ul>
<h5>Usage (elaborate below points)</h5>
<ul>
<li>Based on the above knowledge, in system programming, we should allocate memory at compile time i.e stack for better performance. Heap has penalties of memory allocation like system call and search algorithms.</li>
<li>Observability tools are built on the knowledge of CPU register like EBP, ESP and data in the stack relative to these pointers. This along with eBPF () hooks</li>
<li>Static analyzers</li>
</ul>
